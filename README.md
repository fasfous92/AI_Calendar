# Introduction

This Cookbook contains examples and tutorials to help developers build AI systems, offering copy/paste code snippets that you can easily integrate into your own projects.

## About Me

Hi! I'm Dave, AI Engineer and founder of Datalumina®. On my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@daveebbelaar), I share practical tutorials that teach developers how to build AI systems that actually work in the real world. Beyond these tutorials, I also help people start successful freelancing careers. Check out the links below to learn more!
